#This is very simple stuff but the idea of this exercise is to revise and review the coding practice from the very basic.
#Day 1:- Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manupilation and Variables.

age = input("What is your age?")
hometown = input("What is your hometown?")

#String Manupilation
output = f"My name is {name}. I hail from {hometown}. I am {age} years old. I went to {highest_school} for {highest_study}. I like to {hobbies}."
